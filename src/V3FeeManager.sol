///
/// It is expected that this contract will be the owner of the UniswapV3Factory and as such have
/// access to privileged functions on that factory.
///
/// This contract has an admin. The admin retains exclusive right to:
///   * enable fee amounts on the v3 factory; this behavior exercises owner privileges
///   * set a global protocol fee level; this fee (collected and retained for the Uniswap protocol)
///     can be enabled on any pool created by the v3 factory via the public `setFeeProtocol`
///     function, which also exercises owner privileges
///   * set the payout amount; this is the amount of `PAYOUT_TOKEN` that must be transferred in
///     order for an address to claim protocol fees from one or more pools; see the `claimFees`
///     function for more details
///   * set the payout receiver address; this is the address which receives transfers of
///     PAYOUT_TOKEN when protocol fees are claimed
///   * transfer admin privileges to another address
///
/// One privileged v3 factory function that is _not_ reserved exclusively for the admin is the
/// ability to collect protocol fees from a pool. This method is instead exposed publicly by this
/// contract's `claimFees` method. That method collects fees from the protocol as long as the
/// caller pays for them with a transfer of a designated amount of `PAYOUT_TOKEN`. That payout is
/// forwarded to a payout receiver.
///
/// Another privileged v3 factory function that is publicly exposed is the `setFeeProtocol`
/// function. This function sets the protocol fees on a given v3 pool to the `globalProtocolFee`
/// defined in this contract.

  /// A quick example can help illustrate why an external party, such as an MEV searcher, would be

  /// have been activated for the USDC/USDT stablecoin v3 pool. Imagine also the payout token and
  /// payout amount are WETH and 10e18 respectively. Finally, assume the spot USD price of ETH is
  /// $2,500, and both stablecoins are trading at their $1 peg. As regular users trade against the
  /// USDC/USDT pool, protocol fees amass in the pool contract in both stablecoins. Once the fees
  /// in the pool total more than 25,000 in stablecoins, it becomes profitable for an external
  /// party to arbitrage the fees by calling this method, paying 10 WETH (worth $25K) and getting
  /// more than $25K worth of stablecoins. (This ignores other details, which real searchers would
  /// take into consideration, such as the gas/builder fee they would pay to call the method).
  /// Effectively, as each pool accrues fees, it eventually becomes possible to "buy" the pool fees
  /// for less than they are valued by "paying" the the payout amount of the payout token.
  ///
  /// The same mechanic can be extended to include multiple pools at once. When a searcher notices
  /// that the sum of the protocol fees in multiple pools is greater than the payout amount, they
  /// can call this method to claim the fees from all of the pools in a single transaction.

  /// `payoutAmount` may be changed by the admin (governance). Any proposal that changes this amount
  /// is expected to be subject to the governance process, including a timelocked execution, and so
