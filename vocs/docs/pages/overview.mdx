# Phoenix Mechanism 

At its core, the *Phoenix Mechanism* is a modular system for accruing value from a variety
of revenue sources - including Uniswap Protocol fees. Three primary components make up the
system:

1. **_Fee Source_**: onchain activity that generates revenue in arbitrary tokens of arbitrary amounts
2. **_Asset Sink_**: a contract that accepts revenue from multiple *Fee Sources*
3. **_Releaser_**: a contract that defines the economic requirements for releasing funds from the *Asset Sink*

---

In the first iteration of the Phoenix Mechanism, *N* assets are "releasable" from the *Asset Sink* when a `threshold`
amount of [UNI token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984) is "burned" by `msg.sender`

As an economic example:

* Assume 100 UNI is the `threshold` amount
* When the top *N* assets in the *Asset Sink* are worth 100.1 UNI, **anyone** can use the `Firepit.release()` contract to:
    1. Burn 100 UNI
    2. Withdraw the top *N* assets, *valued* at 100.1 UNI
