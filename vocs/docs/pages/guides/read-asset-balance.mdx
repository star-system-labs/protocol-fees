# Reading Asset Balance

As noted in [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices), the `AssetSink's` available asset balance is observed into two places:

* contract address of the `AssetSink` itself
* the `UniswapV3Pool` contract addresses

For example, the *releasable* USDC balance is `USDC.balanceOf(address(assetSink)) + sum of UniswapV3Pool.protocolFees()` for each USDC-paired pool

## Uniswap v3 Pool Protocol Fees

Reading Unswap v3 Pool unclaimed protocol fees requires calling `.protocolFees()` on each `UniswapV3Pool` contract

```solidity
import {IERC20} from "forge-std/interfaces/IERC20.sol";
import {IUniswapV3Pool} from "@uniswap/v3-core/contracts/interfaces/pool/IUniswapV3Pool.sol";
import {IAssetSink} from "@uniswap/phoenix-fees/src/interfaces/IAssetSink.sol";

contract Example {
    IAssetSink assetSink = IAssetSink(0x0);

    function releaseableBalance(address token, address[] calldata pools)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(assetSink)) // [!code hl]
            + _getV3ProtocolFeesUnclaimed(token, pools); // [!code hl]
    }

    function _getV3ProtocolFeesUnclaimed(address token, address[] calldata pools)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 feesUnclaimed)
    {
        uint128 token0Unclaimed;
        uint128 token1Unclaimed;
        for (uint256 i; i < pools.length; i++) {
            (token0Unclaimed, token1Unclaimed) = IUniswapV3Pool(pools[i]).protocolFees(); // [!code hl]
            
            // determine if the requested `token` parameter is `pool.token0()` or `pool.token1()`
            feesUnclaimed += pool.token0() == token
                ? token0Unclaimed
                : pool.token1() == token
                ? token1Unclaimed
                : 0;
        }
    }
}
```
:::note
Uniswap v3 does not support native Ether tokens. Protocol fees in "eth" are accrued as Wrapped Ether (WETH)
:::

Because unclaimed tokens are stored in Uniswap v3 Pool contracts, integrators should use offchain indexing to track 
which pools contain the asset of interest. For example, USDC protocol fees are accrued in many different pools:

* USDC / TOKENA 0.05% Fee
* USDC / TOKENA 0.30% Fee
* USDC / TOKENB 0.30% Fee
* USDC / TOKENC 0.30% Fee
* and so on...

To track which pools contain the asset of interest, we recommend to index the `PoolCreated` 
[event emitted](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Factory.sol#L50) by the `UniswapV3Factory` contract
