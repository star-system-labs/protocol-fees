# System Permissions

The Phoenix system is made up of three primary components, each with their own set of permissions and parameters:

* Fee Source - manages protocol-related fee logic
* Asset Sink - defines the eligible releaser
* Firepit (Releaser) - defines the economic criteria for releasing assets

---

## V3FeeController (Fee Source)

Two elevated addresses: `owner` and `feeSetter`

* The `feeSetter` is an address that has permission to define pool-level protocol fees

* The `owner` is an address that has permission to:
    * Appoint a new `feeSetter`
    * Enable new fee tiers
    * Appoint a new `V3FeeController`

Immutables:
* `ASSET_SINK` - the destination of all fees

## Asset Sink

* The `owner` can appoint a new `IReleaser` contract which defines the economic criteria for accessing the assets held by the Asset Sink

## Firepit (Releaser)

Two elevated addresses: `owner` and `thresholdSetter`

* The `thresholdSetter` defines the `threshold` of UNI that must be burned in order to release assets

    * as noted in [Best Practices](/guides/best-practices), the `thresholdSetter` can introduce value-loss to the protocol or integrators by modifying the `threshold` value during a pending release

* The `owner` appoints the `thresholdSetter`
